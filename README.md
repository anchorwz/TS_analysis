# Time Series data analysis -- Dimensionality reduction

This is a small demo used aim for understand the time series data and the dimensionality reduction problems.
It includs the SAX and a PLA (Piecewise linear approximation) algorithms.

PS: This demo depends on a library called TimeSynth (https://github.com/TimeSynth/TimeSynth), an open source library for synthetic time series in python. It was
used to generate a time series data.
## TS_analysis
A time series is a collection of observations taken over time. Compared
to randomly generated data points, it may contain internal structures, e.g.
seasonal trends or autocorrelation.
